# Rhythm Realm Updates & Fixes

## Critical Fixes Deployed 🚀

### 1. Signup Verification Flow
We fixed the issue where verification emails were not redirecting users back to the app correctly.

**Code Change:**
- Updated `supabase.js` to explicitly include `emailRedirectTo: window.location.origin` during signup. This ensures the verification link contains the correct `redirect_to` parameter.

**✅ REQUIRED ACTION:**
To make this work in Production, you must configure Supabase:
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **URL Configuration**.
3. Under **Redirect URLs**, click "Add URL".
4. Add your Vercel URL: `https://rythm-realm.vercel.app`
5. (Optional) Add `https://rythm-realm.vercel.app/**` for sub-paths.
6. Click **Save**.

### 2. User Profile Stability
We fixed a critical race condition that caused the app to crash or show "0" stats for new users.

**Code Change:**
- Modified `getUserProfile` to gracefully return `null` if a profile is missing (instead of throwing an error).
- This allows the app's self-healing logic in `app.jsx` to detect the missing profile and automatically create it.

## Landscape Mode & Visuals 📱
- **Landscape Support**: Optimized the UI for mobile/tablet landscape mode (compact headers, smaller buttons).
- **Themes**: Integrated distinct visual themes (Neon, Sunset, Ocean, Golden, Forest, Midnight).
- **Audio**: Boosted volume for Bass/Synth and fixed Snare sound.
